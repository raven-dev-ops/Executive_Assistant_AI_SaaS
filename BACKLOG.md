Backlog
=======

The backlog is tracked in GitHub Issues for this repository.

How We Track Work
-----------------
- Every improvement should have a GitHub issue with:
  - Priority label (P0/P1/P2/P3)
  - Type label (bug/feature/enhancement/chore/docs/security/infra/ci/refactor)
  - Area label (backend/frontend/dashboard/chat/widget/ops/k8s/shared/docs)
  - A milestone in the monthly cadence format `YYYY.MM`
- Prefer small, reviewable issues that can ship independently.

Where To Start
--------------
- Check open issues and the current milestone for the next release train.
- For operational readiness items, also review:
  - `docs/ISMS/LOGGING_AND_ALERTS.md`
  - `docs/ISMS/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md`
  - `docs/ISMS/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md`
